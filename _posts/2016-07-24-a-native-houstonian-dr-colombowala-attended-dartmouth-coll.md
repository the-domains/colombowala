A native Houstonian, Dr. Colombowala attended Dartmouth College. Returning to Houston, he graduated from Baylor College of Medicine in 2002, and he completed his residency and Cardiology fellowship at Baylor. While in medical school he earned certification in medical ethics. He completed additional training in Electrophysiology at the world-renowned Texas Heart Institute. 

He started the first cardiac arrhythmia program in Northwest Montana in 2011\. Under his leadership, the program grew into a high volume regional referral center and international care destination. Dr. Colombowala has been involved in multiple large clinical trials. He is a consultant to industry, and he is published and lectures nationally on topics ranging from stroke and sudden death prevention to long-term heart rhythm monitoring. He returned home to Houston in 2015 to be closer to friends and family. 

Dr. Colombowala sees all types of cardiac patients. His care philosophy is to approach patients as individuals, carefully managing risk factors and conditions leading to heart disease and arrhythmia. He implants pacemakers, defibrillators, heart-failure therapy devices, and cardiac rhythm monitors. In addition to treating arrhythmias with medications, he specializes in advanced diagnostic monitoring and catheter-based ablation procedures for heart rhythm disorders, including atrial fibrillation. He is fluent in English, Spanish, and Gujarati. Away from the hospital, he enjoys spending time with his wife Elizabeth and their two boys (soon to be three!). They enjoy travel, fly fishing, and skiing.
